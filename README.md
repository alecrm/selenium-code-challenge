# Selenium Code Challenge

### Assumptions:
- The application works as intended (there are currently no bugs)
- Test users are created in the system. Ideally user generation would be a part of testing, but for this I will pre-create any necessary users and work with those

### Planning:

Note: It has been suggested to not take much more than 2 hours, so I plan to shoot for that.

- Set up driver instantiation and website access
- Create test for the following functionality:
  - Login
  - User creation
  - Posting
  - Liking
  - Commenting
